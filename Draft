Rosaline Story line draft

Since Rosaline is 'single' at the time of the game, she needs to work. Officially, she is a landlady, but only enough to pay the bills. She works,
but only as a second means of income. Due to this, i want to incorporate her work, and the mortgage company into her story. 
  
Her work will be used as a way to introduce an office environment, where she is either the 'Boss' of the office, or has a boss. Her work will be
downtown in one of the buildings just south of city hall. My current thoughts are that if she isn't the boss, then she has some milfy co-workers and a boss. 
Her work won't play too much into her storyline except to introduce the office and coworkers. There may be an office story line if this is the case. 
If she is the boss, then corrupting her will lead her to try to corrupt the office
